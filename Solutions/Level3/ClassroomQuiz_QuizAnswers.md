Here are the answers:

1. The information that will go into the "TRIVIA" list is all of the lines of text from the "Trivia.txt" file.
2. A list is a structure that stores a collection of values, like numbers, words, or variables. Also, another name for a list would an array. 
3. A while loop is similar to an if statement, however each time that the statement is true, the code will run through whatever is inside the while loop over and over again. A while loop will do this function until the statment in the while loop is false. 
4. A parameter is a variable, number, or string that is passed into a function. This is used in this program when you display the text files in the Trivia.txt file. 
5. The line _`if answer_2_rect.collidepoint(mouse_position)`_ checks which option that the user clicked.
6. If you want to check to see if the user got the answer right you would have to write _`if (insert their answer) == answer`_. For example in this program you write, _`if ANSWER_CHOICES[1] == answer`_.
7. The line _`if event.type == pygame.QUIT`_ checks to see if the user has closed the window to the program. This is important to include because you do not want to run the rest of the code if there is no one actively playing the game. 
8. The method _`event.get()`_ gets the mouse click information so that way we know which answer the user selected. 
9. The symbol that you type at the end of an if statement is a ":" different from the usual ending to a line which is ";".
10. After you write an if statement, you have to position the next line inside of the if statement by pressing the tab key on the next line.
