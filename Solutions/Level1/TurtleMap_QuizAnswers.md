# Turtle Map Quiz Answers

This page includes the answers to the Level 1 Turtle Map Quiz!

**No cheating! Make sure you try to answer the questions before you look up the answers!**

Here are the answers:

1. This code imports the `turtle` object, so that you can use all the related methods (that tell your turtle what to do), like `turtle.shape()`, `turtle.penup()`, `turtle.left()`, and `turtle.forward()`.
2. This command grabs files from your folder and hides all of the information that runs in the background of the program, but is still needed to make the program run correctly.
3. Syntax is a set and order of words in code, to give the computer instructions it understands. This relates to the code we write in programs because each code statement we write is syntax. 
4. `setx` adjusts the position of the sprite on the x-axis, or the horizontal line on the program. `sety` adjust the position of the sprite on the y-axis, or the vertical line on the program. 
5. The module is what holds the code, and the method is how we tell the program what to do, but not actually writing it out ourselves. 
6. The part of the code, `turtle.right(180)`, that is the method is "right".
7. The "F5" key will run your program and you will be able to see how the code that you have written out so far functions. 
8. No, `#TODO` will not run as a part of the program, this is a comment line that will often be used to give you instructions on how to write out code for a challenge. 
9. An example of a code command that rotates the turtle sprite is `turtle.right()` or `turtle.left()` and an example of a code command that moves the turtle sprite would be `turtle.forward()`.
10. It will move **forward** by **150 pixels**.
